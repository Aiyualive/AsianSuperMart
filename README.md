# Asian Super Mart
This project was done in collaboration with [Tracy Nguyen]([https://github.com/tramnguyenJC]) for the course [Web Technologies](https://www.bris.ac.uk/unit-programme-catalogue/UnitDetails.jsa?ayrCode=18%2F19&unitCode=COMS32500) at University of Bristol.

We have developed a website for a small shop that sells Asian goods, where one can obtain the shop information, see all the products, modify the database as the admin, add items to a shopping cart etc. The web development is based on the *node.js* platform using the *Express* framework.

## Instructions
Install dependencies:
```
$ npm install
```

Change into the *site* directory and execute the following to start the server application locally on port **3000**:
```
$ nodemon app.js
```
